        <h1>Personal Biography</h1>
        <p>For the past four months, I have been attending a BCIT program called “Technology Entry.” 
            Essentially, it is a program that upgrades your grades and gives you a higher chance of getting into a desired program. 
            I have now completed said program and am now projected to become a System Administrator or a Security Administrator. 
            I have heard that BCIT's education is intense, but also leads you to a place where you can strive in the long run. 
            This is something that I want to commit to, so I am willing to take that deal and do my best to excel in my future years.</p>
            <br>
        <p>English and South Korean are the only languages I am proficient in speaking. My family were all born in Korea, but I was born and raised in Canada. 
            I have no work experience in the IT field; however, I have other experiences I would like to share. My dad owns a dental business in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
            and I have been working for him for about 5 years now. My job consists of making jaw models, scanning jaw models, 3D printing nightguards,
            milling zirconium crowns, and accounting.</p>
